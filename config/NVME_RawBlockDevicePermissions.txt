To ensure that the NVME device is writable, setup a udev config file

Create a file called "nvme.rules" in /etc/udev/rules.d
with the following line, to indicate that the device
is read+write for user+group+other

=======
KERNEL=="nvme*", MODE="0666"
=======

Then ask udevadm to re-read the config file
$ sudo udevadm trigger

This will change permissions on the NVME block devices

$ ls -l /dev/nvme*
