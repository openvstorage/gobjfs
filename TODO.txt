mutex on asd/edge + keep EdgeQueue ref counts to ensure it not released until open iocb exist
API for edge - inProgress
record cpu util
record latency breakdown
measure sendTime/callbackTime = numConnThreads/numRespThreads
set XIO_OPTNAME_LOG_FN & other opt

BUG
* keepalive destroys session (OR) all disconnect destroys session
* maxoutstanding io 64 doesnt work
* server-side error if clients quickly connect-disconnect with shared session ptr
* xio_connect must wait until connection established before doing send_request
* handle errors when some iocb in batch fail and others submitted

add tests
get 16k numbers
get 4k updated numbers
 - server waitTime, srvTime
 - client shmemQueueTime, sendTime, callbackTime
 - diff between sendTimer - recvTimer = netTime

Optim
* change boost shmem queue to something else

Optimizations
* add more negotiation info to opening messages between gateway-host and
     edge-gateway (what is maxoutstanding io, how many portals)
* destroy Edgequeue if pid has crashed


=========

change RoraGateway::run to not do join

1) Add test if edge pid disappears to ensure cleanup
1) TEST for eventfd on NetworkXioClient
1) Merge multiread into xioportal_nowq
1) check owner tid = tid calling aio_wait/aio_read
1) Use IOV_PTR consistently -forego batchsize = 4
3) portal of threads which read from shmem queue 
4) TEST shared session fails on rapid start-stop
6) TEST for half request failures within an aio_readv
7) kill client, kill server and test shutdown
*) configure xio_log_fn on server and client
*) improve 1 client async io perf for server

ADD DOC
One client in one process will only talk to one URI
One client can open connxn to all portals and then round-robin internally

write adapter switch between direct/indirect send

disable flow control ?

define assign_data_in_buf for RDMA

XIO_OPTNAME_MAX_INLINE_XIO_HEADER
XIO_OPTNAME_MAX_INLINE_XIO_DATA
XIO_OPTNAME_CONFIG_MEMPOOL

start and stop portals dynamically

testing 
multiple clients, multiple servers
long runs
