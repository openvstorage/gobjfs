After successful make, the "build/benchmark" directory will have the 
benchmark executables to be run.

=================================================

To run BenchIOExecFile, you need 2 config files in the current directory

1) benchioexec.conf - this provides benchmark options like how many threads 
to run or how many operations to do.  A sample be found in "benchmark" dir

2) gioexecfile.conf - this provides IOExecutor options like what queue 
depth to maintain.  A sample can be found in "src" dir.
