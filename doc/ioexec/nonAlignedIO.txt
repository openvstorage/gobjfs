Options for implementing nonaligned (not 512) writes & reads with O_DIRECT

1) nonaligned reads seem to work.  io_submit just returns the actual amount
read if it was a short read.

2) For writes there are 2 options

a) write the 512 aligned buffer and then truncate to desired file size

b) if incoming job->size is not 512 aligned, then send job to 
   FdQueue and use pwrite().  This requires an fd which was not opened
   with O_DIRECT.
